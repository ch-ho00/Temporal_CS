1. Generating pseudo option answer (in text)
    1.1 Working on the embedding space
        Verification
            is V_"400 hours" is closer to V_"1000 years" compared to V_"100 seconds"

        Average embedding for new optional answers 

    1.2 Text to number to pseudo text

2. How to change how the model is trained / changing from binary to range prediction given a min/max
    model predicts each min/max between 0~1
    given that 0 is smallest option, 1 is largest option
    label = [smallest yes ~ largest yes]
    => very easy to generate more example
    [1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000]
    min                 max
    min         max
        min             max
    [0 ,1, 1 ,0 ,0 ]

    [0, 1, 1, 0]    

    prediction [min, max] conditioned on smallest/largest option
    => during inference no need to run binary classifier multiple times



1 batch / sampler to sample rows of the same question
	1 question / context
	all the options
	question type
	=> 	binary
		prediction interval conditioned on min/max of options
